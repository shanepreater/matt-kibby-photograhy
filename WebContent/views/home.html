		<h2>All about me</h2>
		<p>This website is designed to show off my skills as a
			photographer and designer. I discovered photography around three
			years ago and havenâ€™t looked back since. My design skills and thirst
			for knowledge are constantly evolving alongside my photography.
			Adobe Photoshop became a friend of mine very quickly, and has been a
			great source of inspiration, helping me to regain focus on my
			artistic flair. I am always looking to build on my skills and am
			always playing with new software, InDesign, Illustrator and now
			WordPress.</p>
		<p>
			Take a look around and see what I get up to, and by all means feel
			free to get in touch via my <a href="contact">contact page</a>.
